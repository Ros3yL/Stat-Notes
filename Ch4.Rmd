# 4.1 Probabiility Density Functions

* Def:

A continuous RV is one in which each of the following is true

  * the set of all possible values contains infinite number of possibilities on an interval of the real number line
  
  * no value has positive probability for all x


\[
P(a\leq X\leq b) = P(a< X\le b) = P(a\le X < b)
\]
